        <h4>What my competition is doing right.</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">The three websites I looked at were
            <a href="https://impulsesv.com">impulsesv.com</a>,
            <a href="https://mumbo.store">mumbo.store</a>,
            <a href="https://griam.store">grian.store</a>.
            What each do well at is selling there product.
            Right when you open the page you can clearly see their merch and what they all look like.
            Its also very obvious whos website your on. Impulse's website is the closest to what I want to do.

        <h4> What my competition is doing wrong.</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;"> If I go to Grian's website, one of the biggest minecraft content creators, I want
            to be able to see a very organized and easy to read way to find and watch his video's.
            He has a lot of iconic series under his belt that you have to scrounge around youtube to find.
            And you could say, well he has youtube playlist. However, thats a lot of scrolling and searching still. Its
            not always super clear either what exactly im going to watch is.
            If he had a section with his series and each season it would be so easy to find what I'm looking for.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Mumbo is a tad confusing. There are two websites that could be his.
            The first one being the website mentioned above. The second website
            <a href="thatmumbojumbo.com">thatmumbojumbo.com</a>, is most likely his and does most the things this
            website does.
            However the fact that there is two sites leaves room for confusion and doubt of the credibility of the
            second website.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Impulse does almost everything this site does. What it doesn't do is give a
            organized hub of video's/series.
            Impulse is a notorious redstoner like Mumbo, and has several redstone inventions still used today.
            Whats annoying is he doesnt make redstone tutorials anymore and there is no great way to find his old ones.
            Using the Youtube playlist is just confusing cause you have to scroll with no real organization.
        </p>
        <h4>What can I do Better</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">My goal is to take whats great about all these sites, and combine it into a
            singular, organized, website.
            What you can expect to see is easy to find sections pointing to my videos, merch, projects, socials, and
            support.
            In my videos Ill even go a step further and have all my series seperated out with descriptions for both.

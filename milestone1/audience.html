        <h4>Where Does My Primary Audience live?</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">As right now I am small creator, I will mainly focus my location to the untited
            states.
            I know there is a large demografic of minecraft enjoyers in places in the UK, howver since I am just
            starting out I think it best to stick with what I know and eventually build apon it.</p>
        <h4>What Age Am I targeting?</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">I hope to be entertaining to any age that wishes to watch.
            I will always keep it PG. End of story. Minecraft is a game built for everyone to enjoy, and I hope to
            entertain as well as teach anyone who cares to click on my video.
        </p>
        <h4>What Gender am I targeting?</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Like I said before, I hope to entertain or teach everyone. I am a huge Star Wars
            and comic book movie nerd and hope to create a safe space for everyone.</p>
        <h4>Other Demografics</h4>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">As I stated before I am a huge Star Wars and comic book movie nerd.
            I hope that part of me can resonate with those like minded to me and attract others.
            I have a variety of interests and hope to relate with my viewers and make them feel comfortable in my
            community.
